I've always wanted a write-only mode of mastodon. So that I can just go posting something without any distractions of new posts from my timeline. Combining that plain text, I made this \[mastodon-md\]([https://github.com/29decibel/mastodon-md](https://github.com/29decibel/mastodon-md)). All you need is to write something in the \`queue.md\` file. Then it will be posted (or manually bun run post).

\> I would also argue that in a lot of cases, even if the Ruby approach is less safe, being able to generate methods and properties at runtime can be less error-prone. If I only have to write that code once, it’s a small surface area for bugs.

Well put! I can resonate.

The key, again, is not to get the "correct" answer. Rather, it should always prompt us to express what we just learned, using our own words.

Traditional RAGs's purpose is always trying to get the "correct" answer. What if that's just a very narrow view of one use case. What if using RAG to help us finding the answers by ourself, using our own word. Basically a constrained RAG, but active our inner learning desires.

I am more and more convinced that the future of learning is "conversational". Wether reading an article or a book is essentially having a conversation with the author, the process of the conversation is not only turn passive learning to active learning, but also cement the understanding.

I seriously believe 2024 would be a year of PWA, well at least for me. The lightweight, always update to date, no single authority (app store), offline support (depends on certain apps), makes it so charming after so many years. Lots of time you just need a browser, but having an "app" concept can effective let you focus on the task at hand.  
Oh yeah, I still miss webOS from Palm.

Space plays a critical role on my reading experiences. It's not the medium (paper vs eink/screen) matters the most, but where I read decides how much I can absorb the information.  
This could applies to library, train, coffee shop, car.

Working on Svelte is so rewarding as a long time vanilla JS developer. All the accumulated web knowledge over the years just instantly available to you, while enjoying the augmented DX.

I have to say that's the best thing happened to the web. Imagine you don't need to throw away everything in order to progress, instead just enjoy the compounding benefits of your existing web knowledge.

Thank you Svelte team!

\> The web equivalent is: the websites you create — their content and functionally for end users — are more important than the tools you use to create them.

\> What your site is built and served with is ephemeral, but the content is what has a chance to last.

The more I use it, the more I love SvelteKit. It has very few but very powerful concepts. Which not only takes you very far, but also gives you a solid foundation.

The only thing I hope would improve would be the printability of the doc.

SvelteKit “Form actions” is the single most underrated feature. I use it to power 95% of the mutation happens to my projects, I no longer needs that much JSON API endpoints. It's dead simple as it leverages the native web form to send data, you can easily extend it using use:enhance or your own customized handler to provide a better UX.

Oh it works without JS. What a charming thing!

Like it or not. I often found Rails or those server side rendered frameworks are the first ones to embrace the web. Maybe because they have to due to the deliberately limited usage of JavaScript. Maybe because that's just the core value of their pushing to simplicity and less code.

I am amazed by the causal usage (in an elegant way) of web components in a server side rendering environment from [@feedbin](https://feedbin.social/@feedbin)

If you are wondering how to display 3rd party HTML content (like a newsletter) on your web app, or interested to see web components used in the wild, or even wondering if we can deliver outstanding UX using server side rendering. Then you should really checkout [@feedbin](https://feedbin.social/@feedbin)

Plus they are open source.👏

Custom service is such a underrated feature from @feedbin. I love its open-ness, there are APIs too. It has the clean, taste of NetNewsWire but more open.

Plan to migrate NetNewsWire to it soon. The main problem with NetNewsWire is I can't easily export items or starred articles.

Working on a project with clear backend and frontend separation is miserable. As the backend engineers are optimizing for a different target than frontend. Well designed, elegant data models turns out to be 5 API calls to render a single simple screen.

I am not a big fan of the “full stack” phrase, but vertical development is truly amazing to deliver things faster. Also arguably better as it's more coherent.

[@ia](https://mastodon.online/@ia) One huge difference between AI for driving and AI for writing is that we don’t care about the “coherence” of getting to somewhere, but that “coherence” matters a lot (if that’s not the whole point) for expressing your thoughts using words.

And by using AI in the process of writing disrupting that exact flow, which often turns out to be bad writings no matter how grammatically correct it is.

\> When other people build tools for us to use, they either design tools after their own workflows and mental models, or worse, they design it for a mass market of millions of people who all sort-of-but-not-really work and think in similar ways. The result is that mass-market productivity tools don’t fit the way our individual minds are predisposed to work. Instead, to use these tools, we need to bend our workflows to fit around the tools.

Small is beautiful.

htmx-Why I Tend Not To Use Content Negotiation

[https://htmx.org/essays/why-tend-not-to-use-content-negotiation/](https://htmx.org/essays/why-tend-not-to-use-content-negotiation/)

I agree with the approach, but I can also understand the concerns as it's very controversial. Engineers are very allergic to repeat things.

But thinking from another perspective, the Data API might have a entirely different shape than the markup API, because they served in different use case, might have different experiences as well. Having the tendency to always have unified API sometimes actually harm the eventual UX.

[@curious\_carrot](https://mastodon.social/@curious_carrot) What I found useful to convince the stakeholders is just trying to be honest and customer driven.

Because web components makes the lighter JS and faster user experience, giving engineering “ever green” technology to work on rather than spending huge time dealing with dependencies upgrades, API changes, security risks.

So start from where the stakeholders are, then drive to the same destination so both wins. 😀

Some no brainer use cases to use web components:

\- Build a 3rd party SDK to render some small elements on other people’s page  
\- UI library supporting multiple frameworks (design systems)  
\- Mainly server side rendering but want one or two interactive component on the page  
\- Chrome extension needs UI

Combining web components with import map, I believe you can get pretty far without jumping into the node/npm black hole. 🕳️

Wow web components seems picked up a lot of momentum from the community recently 💪

Seems I made the right decision when I was making the Amazon Pay SDK / checkout button ([https://pay.amazon.com](https://pay.amazon.com)) 4 years ago.

\- shadow dom to isolate styles  
\- lightweight SDK (9k) total for the entire JS SDK  
\- no dependencies

Worth mentioning we also used CSS Grid for the button layout. Always fun to write vanilla JS using platform APIs

[@jasongorman](https://mastodon.cloud/@jasongorman) I am more optimistic than this. On the surface, yes this might be the feeling everyone get, because customer seems not happy no matter how good the software is until you take away something. But at the same time, there are lots of customer who just left rather than complaining and cheering for you after the bug fixed.

Another perspective is we all break things, but showing the care by fixing them fast is not a bad way to show we care.

So true. I am instantly suspicious on any websites which appears to be“app” like, cause the next JS error is not far away.

On the contrary, the traditional plain server side render web pages feels more trustworthy, as the form submission just works, no spinner all around the page, it's even easier to crawl the page if you have too.

Writing Elixir (LiveView) is for sure becoming a therapy for me. It makes you feel you can do so much more with so little in an elegant way, so that you can spend more time not programming. While you are doing it, you are harnessing the 100% creativity joy from it.

I think at first I celebrates ChatGPT to encourage us asking way more questions than before. Finally the era of “fear to ask stupid questions ends”. But at the same time I am worrying if we will ask too many lossy questions, questions we don't even think about twice before saying/typing it.

So I guess it goes both ways. Maybe I should setup the ChatGPT in a way to see my questions more critically, or simply rephrasing the question for me so that I can learn what's are good questions looks like.

Tauri's developer experience is really top notch! Also somehow the separation of different languages is less confusing than using Electron, cause you always have clear mind that the Rust code is always on the main thread rather the renderer.

Excited to build more stuff using it in the future.

[#imba](https://mastodon.social/tags/imba) on the other hand. Taking a totally different direction, which enables us to write less, so it's more maintainable.

Oh for sure I would much prefer later.

TypeScript is to trying to solve the problem by adding another problem, Imba is to frame the problem in a different way.

Not sure why I am totally ignored [#imba](https://mastodon.social/tags/imba) when it first came out around 2021 (at least at that time it was posted in HN). But I really really like it when digging deeper. (Yes I was a Ruby developer and I used Coffeescript before).

What's interesting is to build reliable and maintainable software, generally two directions we could go with, one is TypeScript - adding types, so we put lots of guard rails so that it could not go wrong easily as before. But it adds even more code.

I have to admit that I don't buy into this idea. 10X developer most of the time is not about how fast they can write the code, but how good the thinking are before coding starts. On the contrary, I often felt that in the auto pilot mode makes developer harder to engage when they wanted to. Cause all the little details here and there are all created in different style by “others”.

I found ChatGPT excels especially for learning frameworks or tools which has poor documentation or limited resources. I learned a lot from it efficiently on AppKit etc.

However, it won't replace the overall design of the software you are trying to build, which I feels like it enabled every developer to be an “architect” rather than knowing every little details of how to achieve individual tasks (not saying it's not important).

Quota’s AI answer is funny and cold. I don’t want to read another machine generated neutral tone of the pale TLDR version. I want to read people’s opinions, the more opinionated the better, I want to see the human face avatar of the given answer, I want the imperfection of it, the silly part of it. To me the human answer shows beliefs and warm, while all the AI answer cares about is that it “sounds” about right.
